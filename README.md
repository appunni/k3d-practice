# K3d Practice

This repository is dedicated to learning Kubernetes with K3d.

## About

K3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Lab's minimal Kubernetes distribution) in Docker. It makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in Docker for local development on Kubernetes.

This repo used for:
- Learning Kubernetes concepts in a local environment
- Experimenting with Kubernetes features using K3d
